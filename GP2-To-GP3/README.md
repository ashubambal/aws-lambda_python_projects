Project Name: GP2-to-GP3 Volume Conversion

Description : 

As a cloud Engineering team, we take care of the AWS environment and make sure it is in compliance with organizational policies. We have used AWS Cloud Watch in combination with AWS Lambda to govern the resources according to the policies.

Here, We will automate and trigger a Lambda function when an EBS volume is created, we will use Amazon Cloud Watch events, Coud Watch events allow us to monitor and respond to EBS volumes that are a type of GP2 and convert them into GP3.

Step 1: Create Events using CloudWatch Service
Step 2: Written Lambda code
